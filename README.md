# Motivation
As I come across various packages and functions, I sometimes explore their functionalities quickly.\
Within this repository, I store the scripts resulting from such *random* explorations. \
By creating this repository, I wanted to -
- store these scripts somewhere, and
- showcase my consistency in learning new things.
